# He and Geng: Geometric Control Trajectory Tracking of Nonholonomic Agents Implementation

This is an implementation of theory presented in He and Geng's paper [1], trajectory tracking of nonholonomic mobile robots via geometric control.

## Results
### Instructions
To run the simulation, run [tracking.py](graphs/tree_matching.py).
Corresponding trajectories will be stored in [data/](data/).

### Setpoint Tracking (Stationary Leader, Single Follower)

_A replication of Figure 1 in [1]. The follower tracks the leader._

### Trajectory Tracking (Dynamic Leader, Single Follower)
